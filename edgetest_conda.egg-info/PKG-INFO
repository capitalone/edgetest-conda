Install
-------

Installation from PyPI:

```console
$ python -m pip install edgetest-conda
```

Installation from conda-forge:

```console
$ conda install -c conda-forge edgetest-conda
```



**NOTE**: This plugin uses ``conda create ...``, so you need to be in a ``conda`` base environment
or you must run

```console
$ conda install conda
```

in your current environment.

Getting Started
---------------

This plugin allows users to create virtual environments using ``conda`` instead of ``venv``.
With this plugin installed, you can also specify packages that you want to install via ``conda``
as well as the python version for your environment(s):

```ini
[edgetest.envs.myenv]
conda_install =
    graphviz
python_version = 3.10
upgrade =
    myupgrade
```

**NOTE**: The default python version is 3.10.
